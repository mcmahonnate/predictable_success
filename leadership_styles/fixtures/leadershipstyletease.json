In \u2018The Synergist\u2018 you\u2019ll learn how Processors can contribute the very best from their detailed, analytical approach while ensuring the other team members don\u2019t become frustrated or impatient.</p>\r\n"}, "model": "leadership_styles.leadershipstyletease", "pk": 1}, {"fields": {"style": 0, "tease": "<p class=\"leadership-style-description\"><img class=\"pull-left leadership-style\" src=\"https://predictable-success.s3.amazonaws.com/media/leadership-styles/the_visionary.jpg\"></p>\r\n<h2  class=\"leadership-style-title\">The Visionary</h2>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">The Visionary is one of four leadership styles which together enable any organization, division, department, project, group or team to get to (and stay in) Predictable Success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Most Visionaries possess similar traits: big-thinkers turned on by ideas, they\u2019re easily bored with minutia and are consumed by the need to create and to achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Visionaries are often (although not always) charismatic. Engaging communicators, able to motivate people to bring their best in every endeavor, they inspire deep loyalty in others, and frequently a small, tight team or \u2018posse\u2019 will develop around them, a group of committed individuals who share the Visionary\u2019s\u2026well, vision \u2013 and who want to help see it realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Even if you\u2019re not a Visionary yourself, you certainly know a few, and meet them at work \u2013 they\u2019re the passionate, ever-hyperlinking, \u201830,000-feet\u2019 big-picture types who arrive back from most weekends and vacations with yet another bright idea, the \u2018glass-half-full\u2019 optimists who believe (and frequently demonstrate) that there\u2019s always a way through every problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">You can recognize a Visionary through a few behavioral traits:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"leadership-style-description\">\r\n<li><em>They abhor routine.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They adore discussion and debate.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They\u2019re comfortable with ambiguity.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They like risk.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They trust their own judgment \u2013 and use it often.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They aren\u2019t wedded to past decisions.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Visionaries are an essential element in any high-performing group or team, but they can be disruptive if not managed correctly \u2013 and of course, Visionaries dislike being \u2018managed\u2019. In \u2018The Synergist\u2018 you\u2019ll learn how Visionaries can be successfully integrated into any group or team, and how their highly valuable skills and undoubted passion can be harnessed for the benefit the enterprise as a whole.</p>"}, "model": "leadership_styles.leadershipstyletease", "pk": 2}, {"fields": {"style": 1, "tease": "<p class=\"leadership-style-description\"><img class=\"pull-left leadership-style\" src=\"https://predictable-success.s3.amazonaws.com/media/leadership-styles/the_operator.jpg\"></p>\r\n<h2  class=\"leadership-style-title\">The Operator</h2>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">The Operator is one of four leadership styles which together enable any organization, division, department, project, group or team to get to (and stay in) Predictable Success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Operators are the \u2018do-ers\u2019 in any enterprise \u2013 they\u2019re the practically-minded folks that get stuff done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Operators work well alongside Visionaries, and in a sense, they\u2019re mutually dependent \u2013 a Visionary needs an Operator to translate his or her vision into day-to-day tasks \u2013 and then to get those tasks completed. An Operator, on the other hand, looks to the Visionary for the big picture, for motivation and inspiration in the tough times, and for the flexibility and lateral thinking to change the enterprise\u2019s direction if things aren\u2019t working out.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Because of their task-oriented disposition, Operators are often hard to spot in an office environment. Easily bored by meetings and unimpressed with simply putting in \u2018face time\u2019, Operators don\u2019t like to sit around idly, and can usually be found in jobs that keep them on the move.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">You can recognize an Operator by certain behavioral traits:\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"leadership-style-description\">\r\n<em><li>They\u2019re action-oriented.</em></li>\r\n<em><li>They improvise to get things done \u2013 and move on.</em></li>\r\n<em><li>They ask forgiveness, rather than permission.</em></li>\r\n<em><li>They work prodigious hours.</em></li>\r\n<em><li>They often work alone.</em></li>\r\n<em><li>They don\u2019t like being micromanaged.</em></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Unless you\u2019re working for a full-blown bureaucracy, no group or team, no organization or enterprise can ever achieve its goals without Operators. However, the Operator is not naturally inclined to play well in teams and in meetings \u2013 they\u2019d much rather be out on the front line, getting stuff done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">In \u2018The Synergist\u2018 you\u2019ll learn how Operators can be involved positively in any group or team\u2019s activities without feeling either over-managed, or that they\u2019re being pulled away from the front line for too long.</p>"}, "model": "leadership_styles.leadershipstyletease", "pk": 3}, {"fields": {"style": 3, "tease": "<p class=\"leadership-style-description\"><img class=\"pull-left leadership-style\" src=\"https://predictable-success.s3.amazonaws.com/media/leadership-styles/the_synergist.jpg\"></p>\r\n<h2  class=\"leadership-style-title\">The Synergist</h2>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">The Synergist is one of four leadership styles which together enable any organization, division, department, project, group or team to get to (and stay in) Predictable Success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">The Synergist brings a primary focus on what is best for the enterprise as a whole, and they choreograph and harmonize team or group interactions to produce high-quality decisions. Adding the Synergist style to a VOP (Visionary\u2013Operator\u2013Processor) group releases it from the gravitational pull of gridlock and compromise, and transforms it into a high-performance team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">You can recognize a Synergist by certain characteristics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"leadership-style-description\">\r\n<li><em>They are more comfortable in group environments than elsewhere. In fact, they positively flower when in the company of others.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They have a high degree of EI (emotional intelligence), and are skilled at relating to people and at building strong relationships.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They are particularly skilled at understanding and managing the dynamics of group interactions.</em></li> Not only do they read individuals well, Synergists also read groups well.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They are persuasive without being manipulative.</em></li>\r\n<li><em>They ask \u201cWhat\u2019s best for the group or team overall?\u201d rather than \u201cWhat\u2019s best for me?\u201d.</em></li>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Unlike the Visionary, Operator and Processor styles, which are natural and innate to all of us, the Synergist style is primarily a learned style \u2013 meaning anyone can learn to be a Synergist. In \u2018The Synergist\u2018 you\u2019ll learn how any leader can learn to transcend their natural Visionary, Operator or Processor style to become transcendent Synergist leaders (without losing any of their V, O or P strengths) \u2013 and how Synergists can learn to lead any team, anywhere, any time.</p>"}, "model": "leadership_styles.leadershipstyletease", "pk": 4}]
