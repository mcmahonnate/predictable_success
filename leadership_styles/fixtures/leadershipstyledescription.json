Your Operator bias means that you are particularly good at pushing things through to completion and making sure you and others don't lag behind in execution. It's also likely that you improvise freely, hot-wiring solutions as needed in order to get things completed.

You may get frustrated at always being the all-rounder, and wish that there was a specific area of activity that you dominate (hardly the worst problem to have).

It's also possible that you delegate less than others say you should - both because of your innate Operator bias (Operator's tend to have a 'give it here' response to issues), and because you believe you can complete most tasks yourself to a high level of competence. (Bear in mind that the assessment measures preferences, not competency - you may well have disciplined yourself to overcome such tendencies.)</p>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">Having said that, whether you work at the front line or in senior management, the ease with which you can move from one area of focus to another is a significant strength - congratulations!</p></div></div>", "secondary_style_first": null, "dominant_style_second": null, "primary_style_second": null, "dominant_style_first": null}, "model": "leadership_styles.leadershipstyledescription", "pk": 24}, {"fields": {"well_rounded": false, "primary_style_first": 1, "name": "Primary Operator - Secondary Visionary", "secondary_style_second": null, "well_rounded_preferred_style": null, "description": "<div class=\"clearfix\"><div class=\"description-image\"><img class=\"pull-left leadership-style\" src=\"https://predictable-success.s3.amazonaws.com/media/leadership-styles/the_operator.jpg\"></div><div class=\"description-copy\">\r\n<h2 class=\"leadership-style-title\">Primary Operator - Secondary Visionary</h2>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">From your results (primary Operator + secondary Visionary), I'd guess you are likely to be hard working, inspiring others with your commitment and dedication.

You don't get bogged down by detail or allow obstacles to get in your way. When you decide to do something, you get it done, often finding innovative ways to get around barriers. You like every day to be different, and enjoy being able to improvise 'on the go'. You're also able (when you need to) to work with others to get your vision implemented. You like challenges and aren't cowed by risk, and you likely can be very persuasive when you want team members to jump on board with a particular concept or vision you've come up with. You're passionate about anything you believe is important, and you bring new ideas and concepts to all you do.</p>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">If I had to take a swing at where you might occasionally struggle, I'd hazard a guess that it's in making sure you take a structured, disciplined approach to execution. You may be subject to 'shiny new ball' syndrome, whereby you start one initiative, then shortly afterward move on to another before fully seeing the first through to completion. With those initiatives you do stick with, you may improvise a lot, working outside of accepted systems and processes in order to push things through to completion. This willingness to 'color outside the lines' when necessary may sometimes irritate colleagues, especially Processors, who on a bad day (theirs, of course, not yours :) may even see you as cavalier. I'd also guess that you're essentially optimistic and forward-thinking and get frustrated quickly with others who don't share your approach.

You're passionate about what you do, committed to it, and can be very persuasive when you want others to buy into your ideas.

You get bored by monotony and sameness, and loathe mediocrity or 'phoning it in'.</p>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">If I had to take a swing at where you may occasionally struggle, I'd hazard a guess at losing interest when you have to take a structured, disciplined approach to executionparticularly when forced to follow systems and processes dictated to you by others. You get things done, but often by circumventing established systems and processes, which may irritate some of your colleagues, especially Processors. I'd also guess that you instinctively prefer doing things yourself rather than working on a big team, which may mean you have difficulties delegating. Your schedule may be somewhat chaotic, and others may find trying to tie you down a little frustrating. You likely don't enjoy 'kumbaya'-type activities where there is a lot of talk and little action, which means at times, others you work with (particularly Synergists) might view you as a maverick, or as an 'outsider', not pulling together with the wider team as much as they'd like.

You're fun to be around: you have a low boredom threshold and little tolerance for routine or the mundane. You are passionate about what you believe in, and can't abide mediocrity. You incite others to strive for excellence and hold a high performance bar. You like to find creative, innovative solutions to problems, aren't deterred by risk and you're quite prepared to 'swing for the fences' when you need to. You can be very persuasive when you need to be and will typically build a tight, loyal team working around you. You crave variety in every day, and work hard to get it - you won't be tied down by routine or processes, and you refuse to be inhibited or constricted in ways that choke off your creative flow.</p>\r\n<p class=\"leadership-style-description\">If I had to take a swing at where you may occasionally struggle, I'd hazard a guess that it's in working with detail and making sure you take a structured, disciplined approach to execution. After you've envisaged the solution to something, you may lose interest in the mundane details of its execution. It's possible you might also suffer from 'shiny blue ball' syndrome: your passions transfer quickly and easily from one brilliant idea to the next, and it may leave some of your colleagues (especially Processors) suffering from whiplash as they try to keep up. I'd also guess that your craving for variety and desire to not be tied down by routine makes you unpredictable in the eyes of others, many of whom may wish for more consistency and stability in their interactions with you. I'd also guess you like to be optimistic and forward-thinking, and you may quickly become frustrated with others who don't share your approach.
