<p><strong>Find Your Fool Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>The Motley Fool, TMF Works, LLC ("TMFW" or "we" or "us") and Predictable Success, LLC are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement sets out our privacy practices and explains what we do with the personal information that we collect from you on www.findyourfool.com. Please read the following to understand our practices regarding personal information and how they affect you as you use our features and services. This statement discloses our current privacy practices; if we make material changes to these practices, we will announce them and notify you via email.</p>
<p><strong>What Information Does <em>Find Your Fool</em> Gather About You?</strong></p>
<p>TMFW and Predictable Success collect information about the participants of the <em>Find Your Fool</em> product so that we can provide a more interesting and useful service. We ask for your name, email address, and other personal information when you register. In order to provide you with results, we also collect testing information. This information includes the results of your testing, the results of your team&rsquo;s testing, and the information that you provide in your answers. We sometimes conduct surveys as well, although you do not have to respond to them.</p>
<p>We collect IP addresses for site security and to help us understand how people use our sites so that we can improve our sites and our users' respective experiences. For similar quality reasons, we use a feature known as a "cookie." Cookies contain bits of information that websites transfer to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more convenient by storing information about your preferences on a site. Although we may assign your browser a cookie, the cookie does not tell us who you are. Only you can tell us that. We discuss cookies later in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>When you place an order for a product or service, we need to know the sort of information typically used for credit card transactions, such as your name, mailing and billing addresses (and shipping address, if different), telephone number, and credit card number and expiration date. Gathering this information allows us to process and fulfill your order and notify you of your order status. We will also use your information to contact you regarding your order if necessary. We encrypt all of this information using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) technology.</p>
<p>We may also collect your email address when you submit content to our sites (for example, a contest entry, or a review of a product). Unless we get your approval, we will not display your address with your submission.</p>
<p>Besides cookies, we may also use tiny electronic images (called "single-pixel GIFs" or "Web beacons"), which allow us to count users who have visited specific pages or access certain cookies. We may use single-pixel GIFs in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To count and recognize users.</li>
<li>To conduct research on behalf of some partners on their websites, and for auditing purposes.</li>
<li>To determine aggregate information about users, including demographic and usage information.</li>
<li>To determine which email messages were opened (and when), as well as acted upon when we send HTML-formatted email messages (messages resembling Web pages that include graphics).</li>
<li>To help us and our partners market to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Web beacons do not collect personally identifiable information. &nbsp;You can disable our Web beacon by turning images &ldquo;off&rdquo; in your email client.</p>
<p>We have partnered with Google (through their Remarketing and Ad Words programs) and other ad networks for additional analytics on how our users use our site and others around the internet. As a result, you may see ads from those partner networks on our site, and ads from us on other sites, based on our cookies and the cookies of our partners. &nbsp;Some of these third party partners may receive &ldquo;hashed&rdquo; data, including email address, in a format that allows them to match the data with data they receive from other partners, but does not give them the ability to decode the email address. All of these ad networks may collect non-personally identifiable information, like hashed data, browser type, time and date, demographic data, etc.) to help them better serve you advertising.</p>
<p>We have engaged third-party companies to process information about our users on our behalf, to help us improve our sites and find new members. These companies will combine our anonymized data about how you visit our websites with information that they have collected from outside our sites and provide it to us (and only us) so that we can optimize your experience on fool.com across devices and based on your interests. We will not provide the third-party service providers with your name, address, email address, or telephone number.</p>
<p>If you would like more information about the information we are receiving and your choices with respect to that data, please:</p>
<ol>
<li>visit the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Google Analytics opt-out program</a> to learn how to opt out of having your information collected in browsers for ad serving purposes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How Does <em>Find Your Fool</em> Use Your Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p>TMFW and Predictable Success collect personal information to provide you, the user, with the best and most personalized experience possible, to provide you with the <em>Find Your Fool</em> testing and service, as well as to provide our advertisers with an efficient way to reach the right audience. In short, by knowing a little about you, <em>Find Your Fool</em> can deliver more relevant content and advertisements to you.</p>
<p>We conduct research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based upon the information you provide us when you register or participate in contests or other promotions on our site, or based upon information we receive from other sources. This research is usually compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis, but may also be combined with personal information to help us improve your experience. We may also notify you of products, services, or areas of our site that we think may interest you based on the information we've received. This information can also be shared among TMFW, Predictable Success and their affiliates. If you would prefer us not to contact you for these purposes, simply go to the <a href="https://www.fool.com/Account/FreeMailSubscribe.aspx">opt-out page</a> on our affiliate site and let us know.</p>
<p>Sometimes we ask for personal information when providing special features and services. You do not have to give us that information, but without it, you may not be able to take advantage of those products or services. For example, you will be unable to track your <em>Find Your Fool</em> results unless you give us an email address with which to send them to you, and you may not be able to gain access to certain areas of our site, including the team results section, unless you register and/or subscribe.</p>
<p><strong>Will <em>Find Your Fool</em> Disclose Any of Your Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p>TMFW and Predictable Success will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Statement. With the few exceptions that we explain here, we do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers, although we do provide aggregate information. For example, we might tell an advertiser that there are 120,000 Registered Fools in Gotham City, but we will not tell them that Batman is one of them, nor will we tell them that his email address is bruce@statelywaynemanor.com. We may also use this aggregated information to help the advertisers reach the kind of audience they want. They may give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males in the 22314 ZIP code). TMFW (or people working on our behalf, under contracts and confidentiality agreements) would then take the ad and display it to users who have told us they meet those criteria. We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, information showing that 35 million of our readers clicked on a particular Web advertising banner last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p>As for individually identifiable information, we may disclose it only under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>The results of your test will be shared with both TMFW and Predictable Success</li>
<li>If you sign up as a Team Member, upon invitation by a Team Leader, your test results will be shared with your Team Leader</li>
<li>We may disclose information to others when we have your consent.</li>
<li>To affiliates of TMFW and Predictable Success, including The Motley Fool, LLC</li>
<li>If you sign up for a special offer from an advertiser, we will provide your individual contact information (for example, name, mailing address, email address, and/or telephone number), so that the advertiser or its agent can fulfill the special offer. Once the advertiser receives the information, it will handle the information under its own privacy policies. Obviously, if you do not want a particular advertiser to have your personal information, then you should not sign up for that advertiser's offer.</li>
<li>If you sign up for a service that relies upon third parties for important elements, we will provide your personal information to the third parties so that they can provide you with their services, and those companies will treat the data under their own policies. We will tell you about these service providers at the time you sign up for the service.</li>
<li>If you provide us with a postal mail address, we may provide that information to advertisers so that they can send you mail about their own products and services. If you do not want such mail, you can throw it in the trash, use it for kindling, or go to the <a href="http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm">opt-out page</a> on our affiliate site.</li>
<li>If you buy something from us, we will disclose your personal information to the extent necessary to fulfill your order and charge your credit card (if applicable). We may use a fulfillment company to fill and ship your order (excluding products you download directly from our site) and a credit card processing company to verify your card number and process the transaction. For example, if you order a <em>Find Your Fool</em> team test with your credit card, we need to give your address to your credit card information to the processing company (to confirm payment). We may also give your information to a delivery or postal service so that it can get your order to you, if applicable.</li>
<li>If you use our service to invite someone to take the <em>Find Your Fool</em> test, TMFW will automatically send this person a one-time email with the applicable links and details. The email address you give us will appear on the "Subject" line of the email, thereby disclosing this information to whoever opens and reads the email.</li>
<li>We may disclose your personal information as required by applicable law, or in response to legal process, to protect the rights or property of TMF and its affiliates or Predictable Success, or to protect the safety of TMFW, Predictable Success our users, or others.</li>
<li>We may sometimes conduct mailings to other people's lists. To make it easier for us to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we may share our email list of people who have requested not to receive promotional communications from us with the list providers (or contractors) solely so that we can avoid sending emails to people who have asked not to receive them (or, conversely, so that our advertisers can avoid sending emails to people who have requested not to hear from them). We provide these lists only to list providers or contractors that we consider to be reputable, and only under strict nondisclosure/nonuse agreements.</li>
<li>We may disclose personal information in some other limited circumstances, but we will specifically describe them to you when we collect the information, such as in the rules of a contest or a new service. For example, if we are going to give personal information to a contest's sponsor, we will disclose it when you sign up for the contest, so that you can decide whether to enter.</li>
<li>We may employ contractors or other third parties to help with our operations. We may give them access to databases of user information, so that they can perform their services for us, including performing system maintenance, displaying personalized content (such as portfolios), performing list analysis or management, or sending mailings for us from our advertisers. These parties are all subject to confidentiality agreements that restrict their use and disclosure of information they obtain through their relationship with The Motley Fool.</li>
<li>Because we are one big, happy family, The Motley Fool and its subsidiaries (including TMFW) may share information for site administration or order fulfillment, and to notify you of products and services that may interest you.</li>
<li>If The Motley Fool is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Kind of Security Measures Do We Take to Protect Your Information From Accidental Loss or Disclosure?</strong></p>
<p>TMFW and Predictable Success are committed to protecting your personal information. We store information you provide us on our secure servers. Further, the information you provide when making a purchase is encrypted with SSL technology.</p>
<p>Personalized areas of our sites are password-protected. Only you have access to these password-protected areas. Do not share your passwords with anyone. TMFW and Predictable Success will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. If you are using a computer to which others have access, such as one in a computer lab, Internet cafe, or public library, always remember to log out and close your browser window when leaving our site.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p>
<p>Upon your request, we will remove your personal information from the website but we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our Terms of Use and take other actions otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>Will We Use Your Information for Direct Mailings?</strong></p>
<p>If you register with TMFW or sign up for or buy any of our products or services, we will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services that we believe may interest you. Our partners in co-branded products may also send you information.</p>
<p>As we stated earlier, we may also provide your physical mailing address (but not your email address) to people who will send you promotional "snail" mailings about their products and services.</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can let us know on the <a href="http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm">opt-out page</a> on our affiliate site, or you may send snail mail to Privacy Penelope, TMFW, 2000 Duke St., 4th Floor, Alexandria, VA 22314. We'll remove your name from our lists as soon as we can. Another way is to simply to click the <a href="http://www.fool.com/community/nevermail.htm">"unsubscribe" link</a> found in our email messages.</p>
<p>Please note: If you purchase products or services from us, or if you register for an account with us, we may contact you to confirm your purchase, subscription, or registration, or to provide you with information about its terms or features. You may wish to keep these transactional or relationship emails, to help you use our products and services.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Respect Children's Privacy?</strong></p>
<p>Our sites are not directed at children under the age of 13. We operate our sites in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone under 13.</p>
<p><strong>What Else Should You Know About Your Privacy?</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement applies to the operations of TMF Works, LLC, which serves users in the United States of America, and by using the sites and providing us with personal data you are consenting to our processing data in the United States and under its laws. Data handling practices and rules may differ from country to country. Each Motley Fool entity (e.g., The Motley Fool, LLC, which operates fool.com in the U.S. or The Motley Fool Limited, which operates fool.co.uk in the United Kingdom) may have different policies, which will apply to (and be stated on) its sites.</p>
<p>While we do our best to protect your personal information, TMFW and Predictable Success cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. What does all of this mean? You must protect yourself. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password and/or account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online, especially when using a computer that other people can use also.</p>
<p>Many of our advertisers or partners, such as merchants, or data providers, link from our site to areas on their own sites where they sell their own products and services. If you follow links from our site to others, you should be aware that you are doing business with those other sites, which have their own privacy and data collection practices. TMFW and Predictable Success have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies (and we may not even know what they are). For more information regarding a site and its privacy policies, check that site.</p>
<p><strong>How Will You Know Whether TMFW's Privacy Policy Has Changed?</strong></p>
<p>We may change this Privacy Statement at any time, but we will give notice of any material change (or any notices that we are required to give you) on our websites and/or in email messages prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy.</p>
