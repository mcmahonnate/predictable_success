    <p>TMFW and Predictable Success do not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the Content found in our Services or its usefulness for any particular purpose. And although we have the hardest-working, most talented techies in the business, The Motley Fool and TMFW make no promises that our content or any of the Services will be delivered to you on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis. In fact, we're not making any promises or warranties except that we'll do our best to provide interesting and helpful information, education, and entertainment. Other than that, we reserve the right to be wrong, stupid, or even foolish (with a small "f").</p>
    <p>Now what does all this mean? It means that you agree that under no circumstances will The Motley Fool, TMFW, its employees, or its agents be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or any other type of damages resulting from your use, purchase, or downloading of any material on our Websites, or arising from or related to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

This disclaimer of liability does not apply in New Jersey.</p>
    <p><strong>Obligatory Capitalized Disclaimers of Liability:</strong></p>
    <p>EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE WEBSITE AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTAINED AND OFFERED ON THE WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND ON AN &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; BASIS. NEITHER THE MOTLEY FOOL NOR ANY OF OUR PARTNERS MAKES ANY WARRANTY THAT THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL THAT YOU PURCHASE OR OBTAIN FROM THE USE OF OUR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR THAT AND ANY ERRORS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED.

    <li><strong> Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong>
    <p>If a dispute arises in connection with your use of our Services or in relation to any of these Terms (collectively, &ldquo;Disputes&rdquo;) our hope is that we can resolve the matter informally. Accordingly, in the event of a Dispute, we agree to first contact each other via email with a description of the Dispute and any proposed resolution. You will email <a href="mailto:findyourfool@fool.com">findyourfool@fool.com</a> with your concern and TMFW or one of its representatives will contact you via the email address we have on file for you.</p>
    <p>If a Dispute cannot be resolved informally, we each agree that except as provided below, the Dispute will be submitted to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) in a location convenient to you. Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA&rsquo;s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. We will pay all of the filing costs, including arbitrator fees. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;<strong>You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.</strong></p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">EXCEPTIONS</span></p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not be subject to arbitration and may be adjudicated only in the state and federal courts of Virginia: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim related to or contesting the validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, or trade secrets; or (ii) an action by a party for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief. You may also file an individual action in a small claims court in lieu of arbitration.</p>
    <p><span style="text-decoration: underline">OPTING-OUT</span></p>
    <p>You will have thirty (30) days from the date you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration you must contact us at The Motley Fool, 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314, Attention: Legal Department. If more than thirty (30) days have passed, you are not eligible to opt out of arbitration.</p>
