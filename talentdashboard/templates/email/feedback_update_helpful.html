            Hi, {{ recipient_first_name }}!
        </p>
        <p>
            We've gotten some good feedback from you on...uh well feedback...and we've tweaked somethings because of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find someone's feedback helpful you can now tell them how helpful it was as well as give explanation (optional) as to why it was helpful:
        </p>

        </p>
        {% if helpful_submissions.count > 0 %}
        <p>
            There is one catch though. We can't carry over the data for the feedback you previously indicated was helpful. I know! We're sorry. We just didn't want to misrepresent how helpful your feedback was to you. For convenience here are the people you had previous said gave you helpful feedback with a link to your feedback page:
            {% for helpful_submission in helpful_submissions %}
                        {% if helpful_submission.anonymous %}
                            <li>Anonymous - <a href="{{ feedback_url }}{{helpful_submission.feedback_digest.id}}">change</a></li>
                        {% else %}
                            <li>{{ helpful_submission.reviewer.full_name }} - <a href="{{ feedback_url }}{{helpful_submission.feedback_digest.id}}">change</a></li>
                        {% endif %}
            {% endfor %}
        </p>
        {% else %}
        <p>
            You can get started <a href="{{ feedback_url }}{{feedback_digest_id}}">here.</a>
        </p>
        {% endif %}
