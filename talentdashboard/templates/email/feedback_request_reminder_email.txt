Hi, {{ recipient.first_name }}!

Don't forget {% if feedback_request_count > 1%}these Fools are {% else %}this Fool is {% endif %}waiting for your feedback:


{% for request in feedback_requests %}
    {{ request.requester.full_name }} {{ domain_url }}/feedback/request/{{ request.id }}/reply
{% endfor %}

This can take as little as three minutes{% if feedback_request_count > 1 %} each{% endif %}, and it will really matter to them!
