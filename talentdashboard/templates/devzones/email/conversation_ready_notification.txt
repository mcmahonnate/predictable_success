Hi, {{ recipient.first_name }}!

It looks like you have development notes for your team.  We're sure your team is itching to hear from you about them. If you haven't done so already:

    1. Have a development conversation with each person below.
    2. Afterwards, update your notes in Scoutmap to reflect the conversation you had.
    3. Share your notes with them in Scoutmap.

Here are your notes:

{% if conversations.count > 0 %}{% for conversation in conversations %}
{{conversation.employee.full_name}}

{% for advice in conversation.advice %}{% if advice.alert_type_for_development_lead %}{{ advice.alert_for_development_lead_short }} | {% endif %}{% endfor %}Leadership: {{ conversation.development_lead_assessment.zone.name }}{% if conversation.employee_assessment %} | Selfie: {{ conversation.employee_assessment.zone.name }}{% endif %}
{{conversation.development_lead_assessment.notes}}

View more here:
{{ response_url }}{{ conversation.id }}

------------------------------------------
{% endfor %}{% endif %}
Thanks!
-The Scoutmap Team
